The kinetics of photoconductivity decay in InGaAs-GaAs structures with different temperatures was measured after switching off photoexcitation with two laser radiation at 650 nm and 980 nm on a single semiconductor sample SC094 with parallel contacts to the quantum wires. A program was developed to automate the processing and visualization of experimental data on the photoconductivity in an InGaAs / GaAs heterostructure with nanoobjects. The obtained results of approximation by the developed program are quite close to the results obtained by the mathematical package Origin 8. Based on the obtained data, the approximation parameters τ and β were calculated and compared. As the temperature is increased, the relaxation time parameter τ decreases.

Key words: approximation, visualization, kinetics of photoconductivity, semicon- ductor, heterostructure junction, quantum threads.
